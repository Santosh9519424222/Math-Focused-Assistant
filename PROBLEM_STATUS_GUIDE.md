## 🔧 Backend API

The status page fetches data from:

### Endpoint: `GET /feedback/problem-status`

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "total_problems": 15,
  "solved_problems": 8,
  "pending_problems": 7,
  "all_solved": false,
  "solve_rate": 53.33,
  "by_type": {
    "bug": {
      "total": 5,
      "solved": 3,
      "pending": 2
    },
    "ocr": {
      "total": 4,
      "solved": 2,
      "pending": 2
    },
    // ... more types
  },
  "recent_problems": [
    {
      "id": 15,
      "timestamp": "2025-10-30T16:30:00.123456",
      "question": "[USER PROBLEM REPORT - BUG]",
      "comment": "Type: bug\nEmail: user@example.com\n\nDescription here...",
      "metadata": {
        "feedback_type": "problem_report",
        "problem_type": "bug",
        "status": "pending",
        "user_email": "user@example.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📝 Marking Problems as Solved

Currently, problems are marked as solved if they have:
1. **`metadata.status`** set to `"resolved"`
2. **`metadata.admin_response`** field present

### How to Mark a Problem as Solved

**Option 1: Manual JSON Edit** (Development)
Edit `backend/data/feedback.json`:
```json
{
  "id": 15,
  "metadata": {
    "status": "resolved",
    "admin_response": "Fixed in version 1.2.0",
    "resolved_date": "2025-10-30T18:00:00"
  }
}
```

**Option 2: API Endpoint** (Future Enhancement)
Create a new endpoint to mark problems as solved:
```python
@app.post("/feedback/resolve/{feedback_id}")
async def resolve_problem(feedback_id: int, resolution: str):
    # Update problem status in feedback.json
    # Add admin_response and resolved_date
    pass
```

**Option 3: Admin Dashboard** (Future Enhancement)
Build an admin interface to:
- View all problems
- Add resolution notes
- Mark as solved
- Filter and search

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Status Page Won't Load
**Issue**: "Error Loading Status" message
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure backend server is running: `cd backend; python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Check backend is on port 8000
3. Verify `feedback.json` exists in `backend/data/`

### No Problems Showing
**Issue**: "No problems reported yet" message
**Solution**:
1. Submit a test problem via the frontend
2. Check `backend/data/feedback.json` has entries
3. Verify entries have `feedback_type: "problem_report"` in metadata

### Link Not Working from Modal
**Issue**: 404 error when clicking status link
**Solution**:
1. Verify backend server is running
2. Check URL in browser: `http://localhost:8000/../problem_status.html`
3. Try opening `backend/problem_status.html` directly

### Solved Problems Not Updating
**Issue**: Marked as solved but still shows pending
**Solution**:
1. Check JSON format: `"status": "resolved"` in metadata
2. OR add `"admin_response": "Fixed"` field
3. Refresh the status page (🔄 button)
4. Clear browser cache if needed
