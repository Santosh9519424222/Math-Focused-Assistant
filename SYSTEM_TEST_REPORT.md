## 🎯 DETAILED TEST RESULTS

### 1. Backend Server Health ✅
```
Status: Running
Port: 8000
Knowledge Base: 5 problems loaded
Response: {'total_problems': 5, 'status': 'ready'}
```

### 2. Knowledge Base & RAG Search ✅

**Test Results:**
- **Test 1: Integration Problem**
  - Query: "How to evaluate integral of x squared times log x?"
  - Result: ✅ Found calc_001 (67.8% similarity)
  - Confidence: LOW (needs >50% for routing to KB)
  
- **Test 2: Cubic Equation**
  - Query: "Solve cubic equation x cubed minus 3x plus 2 equals zero"
  - Result: ✅ Found alg_001 (80.3% similarity)
  - Confidence: MEDIUM (would use KB answer)
  
- **Test 3: Taylor Series**
  - Query: "What is the Taylor expansion of sine function?"
  - Result: ✅ Found trig_001 (62.3% similarity)
  - Confidence: LOW
  
- **Test 4: Non-Math Query**
  - Query: "What is the capital of France?"
  - Result: ✅ Correctly rejected (0 results)

**Routing Logic Test:**
```python
if confidence_score >= 0.5:  # 50% threshold
    → Use Knowledge Base (gemini_analyze)
else:
    → Use Web Search (perplexity)
```

## 🎯 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION

### LangGraph Workflow ✅
```
User Query
    ↓
[search_database] → Vector search in Qdrant
    ↓
[route_after_db_search] → Decision point
    ↓               ↓
confidence≥50%  confidence<50%
    ↓               ↓

```

### RAG Pipeline ✅
```
1. Input Guardrails → Validate question
2. Vector Search → Find similar problems (top 3)
3. Routing Logic → Check confidence (≥50% threshold)
4. Answer Generation → KB or Web search
5. Output Guardrails → Validate & sanitize response
6. HITL Feedback → Collect user ratings
```
